1) Movies folder is main folder which contains the subfolders which are related to devlopment code of the application.

2)If you want to clone this folder and execute the application you have to configure your environment as per technical requirements which I used to develop this application.

3) You have to install python2.7 to 3.7 any version.
	But, I used python python 3.7.2 

4) you have to install mongodb Database in your computer and configure it

5) you have to install the django framework using pip
   like pip install django 2.2.0, I used 2.2.0 version of django for development of this application.

6) after configure all the above requirements then you have ability to execute the application 
in your local machine or computer.
